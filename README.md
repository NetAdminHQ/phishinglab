Awesome! Here's the full, polished `README.md` — already broken into safe, working Markdown sections for GitHub. You can copy-paste this or save it directly to your repo.

## ✅ Final `README.md`

```markdown
# 🧪 phishinglab

A modular Python-based email scanner that detects malicious attachments and suspicious links — **without using paid APIs like VirusTotal**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📬 Fetch unread emails via IMAP
- 📦 Extract `.zip` attachments
- 🧪 Scan attachments using YARA rules
- 🌐 Analyze email links:
  - Detect phishing keywords in domains
  - Flag recently registered domains
- 🔐 Fully offline, privacy-respecting
- 📁 Sorts emails into folders: `Clean`, `ToBeInspected`

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetAdminHQ/phishinglab.git
cd phishinglab
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv phishinglab
source phishinglab/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔐 Configuration

Copy the config template:
```bash
cp config.py.template config.py
```

Edit `config.py` with your email settings:
```python
EMAIL = "you@example.com"
PASSWORD = "your_app_password"
IMAP_SERVER = "imap.example.com"

ATTACH_DIR = "attachments"
EXTRACTED_DIR = "extracted"
YARA_RULE_FILE = "rules/malware_rules.yar"
```

**⚠️ Important:** Never commit `config.py` to GitHub.  
Use `.gitignore` to keep it out of version control.

---

## ▶️ Running the Scanner

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The scanner will:
- Connect to the inbox via IMAP  
- Extract and scan `.zip` files using YARA  
- Analyze links in the email body  
- Flag suspicious domains  
- Move emails to `Clean` or `ToBeInspected`

---

## 🛡️ Safe Usage Tips

- Use a **dedicated test inbox**, not your main account
- Run the scanner in a **virtual machine or isolated environment**
- Never click on suspicious links or files directly
- Sandbox execution should be run in a safe, disconnected VM

---

## 🧪 Roadmap / Future Ideas

- SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation
- Office macro detection
- PDF phishing detection
- Web dashboard (Flask + Tailwind)
- Integration with ELK stack or SIEM

### ✅ Next Steps

Would you like me to generate and save:
- `config.py.template` with placeholders (safe for GitHub)?
- `.gitignore` to ignore `config.py`, virtual env, etc.?

Happy to help wrap this all up cleanly.
